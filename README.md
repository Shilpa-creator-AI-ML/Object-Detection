# Object-Detection
This project implements real-time object detection using OpenCV and the SSD MobileNet v3 model trained on the COCO dataset. It identifies and labels objects in images and webcam video streams, using pre-trained model files (.pb, .pbtxt) and class labels (coco.names) for detection and visualization.
